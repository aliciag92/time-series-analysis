### Pipeline Process:

#### Plan
- Understand project description and goals. 
- Form hypotheses and brainstorm ideas.
- Have all necessary imports ready for project.


#### 1. Acquire
- Download dataset from [Kaggle](insert link).
- Move download to desired folder on personal device.
- Define function to get climate data from local csv and return as a pandas DataFrame.
- Read csv in notebook by using wrangle.py script.
- Function to acquire the data is included in [wrangle.py](insert link).
- Complete initial data summarization and plot distributions of individual variables to get to know data and know what is needed to be prepped/cleaned.

#### 2. Prepare
- Define functions to:
    - clean climate data and return as a cleaned pandas DataFrame.
    - split the dataframe into train, validate, test.
- Functions to prepare the data are included in [wrangle.py](insert link).

#### 3. Explore
- Address questions posed in planning and brainstorming and figure out ______.
- Create visualizations of variables and run statistical tests (as many as needed).
- Summarize key findings and takeaways.

#### 4. Model/Evaluate
- Establish and evaluate a baseline model?
- Generate various time series analysis algorithms with varying hyperparameters (as many as needed) and settle on the best algorithm by comparing evaluation metrics.
- Choose the best model and test that final model on out-of-sample data.
- Summarize performance, interpret, and document results.

#### 5. Deliver
-

### Recreating Project
- To reproduce this project, download [wrangle.py](insert link) and [movie-revenue-report.ipynb](insert link) in your working directory and follow the steps from the pipeline process above.
- You can always obtain more features, or remove the ones you do not want, do your own exploring, modeling, and evaluating to deliver any new information.
